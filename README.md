# Encryption Ciphers

This repository contains implementations of three encryption ciphers: A5/1, Knapsack, and Transposition Cipher. These ciphers provide various methods for encrypting and decrypting messages. Whether you're a cryptography enthusiast or a developer looking to integrate encryption into your applications, this repository has you covered.

## Ciphers Included

### A5/1 Cipher

- **Description**: The A5/1 cipher is a stream cipher used in mobile telecommunications. It's known for its simplicity and was widely used in older GSM networks.

### Knapsack Cipher

- **Description**: The Knapsack cipher is a public-key cryptosystem based on the subset sum problem. It's a relatively simple and educational cipher to explore.

### Transposition Cipher

- **Description**: The Transposition cipher is a simple and classic symmetric key cipher that rearranges the characters in a message to obfuscate it.
